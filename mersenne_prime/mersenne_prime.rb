# MERSENNE PRIME
# CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

# In January 2013, GIMPS contributors discovered the 48th known Mersenne prime number. For this, they received a $100,000 award. A newly announced $150,000 reward will be given to those who will discover the next largest known prime. 
# Do not want to get it? We offer this challenge to you to get ready.

# INPUT SAMPLE:

# The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case with an integer.

# 4
# 308
# OUTPUT SAMPLE:

# Your task is to print all Mersenne numbers that are smaller than the number in a test case. Separate those numbers by commas.

# 3
# 3, 7, 31, 127
# CONSTRAINTS:

# The number in a test case can be from 4 to 3,000.
# The number of test cases is 20.
